Anne's research into their Jewish history and their ties to Lyon's Communist Party reveals the existence of her uncle Jean, who had never been mentioned.\n\nAs she gradually closes in on the discovery she didn't know she was looking for, her father grows ever more ill, and may take the family secret to his grave.\n\nIn a journey that stretches from post-war France to the 1980s, Anne's destiny intertwines with her father's past until they form a single, unforgettable story.
